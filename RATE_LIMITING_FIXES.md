# Rate Limiting Fixes for Cross-Channel Slack Search üõ°Ô∏è

## Problem Identified
The cross-channel indexing was hitting Slack API rate limits, causing failed requests and incomplete indexing.

## Rate Limiting Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Exponential Backoff Strategy**
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with next channel if one fails after retries
- **Smart Error Handling**: Distinguishes between rate limits and other errors

### 2. **Conservative Processing Limits**
- **Channel Limit**: Process max 10 channels per run (was unlimited)
- **Message Limit**: 100 messages per channel (reduced from 500)
- **Time Window**: 30 days lookback (reduced from 60 days)
- **Batch Processing**: Process messages in batches with delays

### 3. **Enhanced Delays Between API Calls**
- **Channel Processing**: 10 seconds between channels (increased from 2s)
- **Message Processing**: 1 second delay every 10 messages
- **API Retries**: Progressive delays for failed requests

### 4. **Rate Limit Detection & Handling**
- **API Response Monitoring**: Detects `ratelimited` error responses
- **Automatic Retry**: Implements exponential backoff for rate-limited requests
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for rate limit events and recovery

## Updated Processing Flow

### **Channel Discovery** (`find_relevant_channels`)
```
1. List all public channels (with retry logic)
2. Match channel names against company names
3. Return relevant channels (with rate limit handling)
```

### **Channel Indexing** (`index_channel_history`)
```
1. Get channel history (with exponential backoff)
2. Process messages with entity filtering
3. Add delay every 10 messages
4. Continue on errors, retry on rate limits
```

### **Cross-Channel Sync** (`discover_and_index_slack_channels`)
```
1. Limit to 10 channels per run
2. 10-second delay between channels  
3. Process with reduced message limits
4. Log remaining channels for next run
```

## Usage Recommendations

### **Manual Sync**
```bash
# Trigger indexing (processes up to 10 channels)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sync/slack-channels

# Run multiple times if you have many relevant channels
# Check logs to see how many channels remain
```

### **Production Deployment**
- Consider running sync during off-peak hours
- Monitor logs for rate limit warnings
- Adjust limits based on your Slack workspace size

### **Monitoring Rate Limits**
```bash
# Watch logs for rate limiting messages
tail -f logs/app.log | grep -i "rate"

# Look for these log patterns:
# "Rate limited for channel #channel-name, waiting 5s"
# "Found X additional channels. Run /sync/slack-channels again"
```

## Performance Optimizations

### **Conservative Approach**
- **Pros**: Respects rate limits, stable processing
- **Cons**: Slower indexing, requires multiple runs for large workspaces

### **Batch Processing Benefits**
- Processes most relevant channels first
- Allows incremental indexing
- Prevents system overload
- Maintains service availability

### **Error Recovery**
- Individual channel failures don't stop entire process
- Automatic retry with backoff for transient issues
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Expected Behavior

### **First Run**
```
‚úÖ Discovers all relevant channels
‚úÖ Processes first 10 channels
‚è≥ Indexes up to 100 messages per channel (30 days)
üìù Logs remaining channels for next run
```

### **Subsequent Runs**
```
‚úÖ Continues with remaining channels
‚úÖ Respects 10-channel limit per run
‚úÖ Maintains rate limiting protections
```

### **Rate Limit Scenarios**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Hit rate limit ‚Üí Wait 5s ‚Üí Retry
‚ö†Ô∏è  Hit again ‚Üí Wait 10s ‚Üí Retry  
‚ö†Ô∏è  Hit again ‚Üí Wait 20s ‚Üí Retry
‚ùå Still failing ‚Üí Skip channel, continue with next
```

## Testing the Fixes

### **Start Server**
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --reload
```

### **Trigger Indexing**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sync/slack-channels
```

### **Monitor Progress**
```bash
# Watch logs for progress
tail -f logs/app.log

# Expected log patterns:
# "Found 47 potentially relevant channels"
# "Limiting to first 10 channels to avoid rate limiting"
# "Processing channel 1/10: #fern-alchemy"
# "Indexed 23 messages from #fern-alchemy"
# "Cross-channel indexing completed. Total messages indexed: 156"
```

The system should now gracefully handle Slack's API rate limits while still discovering and indexing relevant conversations across your workspace! üéâ
